# FWF Readme

There are 4 main components to the FWF processing:

(1) Project RACMO runoff onto polar stereo grid
(2) Route projected runoff to land pixels immediately adjacent to oceans
(3) Compute solid ice discharge time series 
(4) Create ocean basins raster from IHO definitions

Set the environment variable `PROCESS_DIR` to the location where you are undertaking all processing for this project. 


## Projecting runoff to polar stereo grid

This process is very quick - just a few minutes on desktop machine for entire time series.

Script: `reproject_racmo.py`


## Routing

Uses the PyGeoProcessing toolbox. The toolbox only runs under Python 2.7 (at least as far as I can tell), so requires a new conda environment that looks something like this:

    conda create -n pygeoprocess
    source activate pygeoprocess
    conda install -c conda-forge python=2.7 numpy scipy cython gdal shapely
    pip install pygeoprocessing


## Solid ice discharge



## Ocean basins mask

Script: `allocate_coast_to_basin.py`. See script for citation of IHO data source
