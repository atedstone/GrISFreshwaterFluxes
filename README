# FWF Readme

There are 4 main components to the FWF processing:

(1) Project RACMO runoff onto polar stereo grid
(2) Route projected runoff to land pixels immediately adjacent to oceans
(3) Compute solid ice discharge time series 
(4) Create ocean basins raster from IHO definitions

Set the environment variable `PROCESS_DIR` to the location where you are undertaking all processing for this project. 


## Projecting runoff to polar stereo grid

This process is very quick - just a few minutes on desktop machine for entire time series.

Script: `reproject_racmo.py`


## Routing

Uses the PyGeoProcessing toolbox. The toolbox only runs under Python 2.7 (at least as far as I can tell), so requires a new conda environment that looks something like this:

    conda create -n pygeoprocess
    source activate pygeoprocess
    conda install -c conda-forge python=2.7 numpy scipy cython gdal shapely
    pip install pygeoprocessing


## Solid ice discharge



## Ocean basins mask

Script: `allocate_coast_to_basin.py`. See script for citation of IHO data source



## Masks - November/December 2017 update

There are four sources of masks:

RACMO run @ ~11 km point grid resolution
   - LSMGr
   - icemask
   - LandSeaMask
   - Promicemask
   - GrIS_caps_mask
   - Geopotential (topography)
   - ----> all these wind up as mask_<name>.tif.
RACMO @ 1km NCAA
    - Ice mask
    - topography
RACMO @ 1 km SCAA
    - ice mask
    - topography
RACMO @ 1 km GRIS
    - ice mask
    - topography

After racmohires2gtiff.py is run, another two key masks are generated as geotiffs:
- mask_Geopotential_mosaic.tif
- mask_icemask_mosaic.tif
These contain the higher-res (1km-derived) topo and ice masks respectively.

From this point on it is therefore important not to use 11 km base masks in application to any 1km downsampled areas! (the bounds will be wrong).



## Main differences in Nov/Dec 2017 update

* Improved the masking used for the tundra, which led to a dramatic reduction (50%) in tundra runoff compared to runoff v1. New values more in line with Bamber 2012 paper, a little lower in fact.
    - Tundra runoff data are still from the base 11km product resampled to 5km.
    - Using the 11km land mask as that is the only one available from IMAU, but then removing ice from the mask using the PROMICE 1km mask resampled to 5 km resolution. Visual inspection in QGIS of these masks and a couple of 11km-->5km runoff tiles shows that this is a much more accurate approach than using the 11km-->5km ice mask, which when subtracted from land mask still leaves considerable ice margin areas in the land mask, which then get summed erroneously as ice runoff.
* Care in defining ice area is required. Previously, I was using image morphology tools to fill 'holes' in the resampled ice masks. However, this is a dangerous approach because often the holes are caused by fjords which were open to the ocean in the 1 km PROMICE mask but which become occluded upon resampling to 5 km resolution.
    - The solution is not to fill these holes at all. Instead, leave them in place and then just route the water that drains into them via the usual euclidean distance method to the coast. This conserves mass nearly precisely in the few tests I did (+/- a couple of km3 or so).

* The 1km Greenland runoff data show substantially more runoff, especially in 2012. The increases are already present in Brice's 1km data, i.e. the increases compared to FWFv1 are not due to problems with my routing routines.


## Order of scripts

1. allocate_coast_to_basin.py, project_bamber_basins.py
2. project_RACMO.r
3. racmohires2gtiff.py with appropriate options set
4. caa_scale_p2_data.py
5. arctic_runoff_routing.py
6. greenland_runoff_contribution.py
7. solid_ice_discharge.py
8. export_combined_nc.py
9. stats_for_paper.py

compare_runoff_values.py is for separate sanity checking.


## Summary of issues encountered over Dec 2017/Jan 2018

First, there was some confusion associated with the 'very high' fluxes from Greenland compared to published data. The reason for this is that our routed Greenland fluxes include not just the ice sheet itself but also all other ice masses on the Greenland land mass.

Second, we noticed that NCAA fluxes were too low in our early Dec 2017 version of our dataset. We tracked this down to corrupted NCAA RACMO2.3p1 @ 1km runoff grids, which resulted in a geo-referencing offset. Brice provided a new, uncorrupted dataset which we re-mosaiced and then re-ran the routing, solving this problem.

Third, we identified a problem with the RACMO2.3p2 11km undownscaled data over the North Canadian Arctic, whereby the estimates were too low. This is only a problem for 2016, as we have RACMO2.3p1@1km for 1958-2015. We therefore calculated a scaling factor to apply to the 2016 runoff fields, which is applied just before the runoff fields are routed in arctic_runoff_routing.py.

Other more minor issues that were fixed in this release (notionally labelled FWF17.v3):

* Ungrounded Greenland ice was removed from the runoff fields, using a new mask provided by Brice Noel. This is undertaken by modifying the appropriate mask in-memory during execution of arctic_runoff_routing.py.
* A constant 10 Gt/yr solid ice discharge was added to the far north of the GrIS.
* The runoff-discharge regression now uses GrIS-only runoff (whereas before it used pan-Greenland runoff), and 1958 has been removed because we believe there is something suspect about the solid ice discharge value for this year.
* Whole dataset now provided as a single netcdf file.
